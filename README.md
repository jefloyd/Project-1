## About the game:
For ages 6-10... WTF knows


## Synopsis:
Professor Edmund (not Layton) has just opened his library and his first assisgnemnt for you is to take this multiple choice quiz.



## User Story 
Users should be able to easily navigate the page through stylized CSS. Answer each questin by clicking on the button beside your answer of choice.
Once you are finished with the quiz you may hit the submit button to see how many answers you got correct. Correct answers will appear in green text and incorrect answers will red.


## As a developer I want to make sure that styles and functions are correctly implemented so that user can easily interact with game in an intuitive and enjoyable way.
